# First release (beta)

1. Clone this repo.
2. Compile in Xcode (recommended) OR run OpenSwitcher.app
3. Open the app and type your selected hotkey to change a language

# How it works

When you press a selected Manual Switch button, it removes the last typed word, switches the language and sends keystrokes again.

When you type anything it's being recorded to the buffer, and when you type enter / esc / tab it's being cleared.
